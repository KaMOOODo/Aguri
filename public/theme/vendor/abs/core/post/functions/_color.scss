/// Adjusts the lightness of a color based on the provided rate.
/// @param {Color} $color - The base color to be adjusted.
/// @param {Number} $rate - The percentage rate at which the color should be lightened or darkened.
/// @return {Color} - The adjusted color after applying the lightening or darkening process.
/// @description - This function takes a color and a rate as inputs and adjusts the color's lightness.
///                If the color's lightness is greater than the rate, it returns a darker shade of the color.
///                If the color's lightness is less than or equal to the rate, it returns a lighter shade of the color.
/// @example - Using abs-makecolor to adjust color lightness:
///            $primary-color: #336699;
///            $adjusted-color: abs-adjustcolor($primary-color, 20%);
///            This will lighten or darken the $primary-color by 20%, depending on its lightness.
